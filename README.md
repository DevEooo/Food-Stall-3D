# ☕ 3D Stall/Cafe Interior Model Description
This project is a 3D model of an outdoor food stall or casual cafe interior, highly inspired by the popular 'kaki lima' (street food vendors) and small, modern coffee shops often found in urban areas. The design blends a cozy, functional interior space with an accessible, open-air seating arrangement.
